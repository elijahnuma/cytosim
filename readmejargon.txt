Units:
Real time seconds (S)
In-sim seconds (s)

Terminology:
Computational time: time taken to simulate test
Memory usage: max memory taken up on the cluster for simulation
Metadata: computational time and memory usage
Diffusion: squared displacement of objects over time
Contraction delta (work): cluster size at end - cluster size at beginning (um)
Contraction rate (power): change in cluster size rate (metric/s)
Metric computational time efficiency: metric per computational time for simulation (metric/S)
Metric memory usage efficiency: metric per memory usage for simulation (um/S)
Max contraction rate (max power): maximum contraction rate achieved in simulation (um/s)
Max contraction rate time (max power time): when in the simulation the maximum contraction rate occurred (s)
