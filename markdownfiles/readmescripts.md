how to run simulations:
bash copytest.sh OR maketest.sh OR anchormaketest.sh -> bash failedjobscheck.sh -> bash finishedcheck.sh ->
bash runsubmitrecordoff.sh -> bash metadatacollect.sh -> bash runanalyzejobs.sh -> bash datacheck.sh ->
sftp -> get

/gitrepo/

git workflow:
bash copyscripts.sh -> git add -A -> git commit -m "message" -> git push
