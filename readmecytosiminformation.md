Test descriptions format: (time frames, binding range, variable value, motor type)

Units:

Real time seconds (S)

In-sim seconds (s)

Terminology:

Computational time: time taken to simulate test

Memory usage: max memory taken up on the cluster for simulation

Metadata: computational time and memory usage

Diffusion: squared displacement of objects over time

Contraction delta (work): cluster size at end - cluster size at beginning (um)

Contraction rate (power): change in cluster size rate (metric/s)

Metric per computational time: metric time efficiency (metric/S)

Metric per memory time: metric memory efficiency (um/S)

Max contraction rate (max power): maximum contraction rate achieved in simulation (um/s)

Max contraction rate time (max power time): when in the simulation the maximum contraction rate occurred (s)
